### Technique > Matching

1. Read the instructions carefully.
2. Read the questions first. Think about synonyms and how you could paraphrase the statements. This will help you identify the answer. Saying each statement in your own words can help do this.
3. ***Quickly skim the reading text to try to understand the general meaning*** of the text.
4. Read the question statements again and predict which paragraph contains the answer.
5. Scan the text paragraphs you think might contain the answer for synonyms. ***If you find the possible answer underline it***.
6. Check back with the question statement and mark the answer if correct. If not move on to other paragraphs.
