***The graph shows information about*** <u>**the amount of money which was earned by three bakeries in London, over a ten-year peroid between 2000 and 2010.**</u>

***Overall, what stands out from the graph*** is that there were ***considerable upward*** trends in the income of both Bernie's Buns and Robbie's Bakery, while the earnings of Lovely Loaves saw ***a considerable fall*** over the peroid in question. Another interesting point is that Lovely Loaves was ***the most popular*** bakery in 2000, but in 2010, Robbie's Bakery ***earned more money than the others***.

***Looking at the details***, as regards Bernie's Buns, income started at 20,000 in 2000, then there was ***a fluctuation*** over the next three years, at which point ***it levelled off*** at just under 40,000 until 2006. Then the figure ***went up significantly***, finishing at aournd 65,000 in 2010. If we look at Robbie's Bakery, the trend was similar. Having ***remianed stable*** at approximately 55,000 in the first half of the decade, income then **rose sharply**, reaching nearly 100,000 in 2008. There was then ***a gradual rise*** to around 105,000 in 2010.

***By contrast***, the income of Lovely Loaves went in the opposite direction. Taking fluctuated around 90,000 until 2004. After that, despite falling sharply to just over 40,000 in 2008, the figure then levelled off in the last two years.
