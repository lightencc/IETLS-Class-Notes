### Technique > Labeling the diagram

#### Tips

1. Check how many words you are supposed to write.
2.  Identify the type of word (noun, verb, adjective) you need.
3. The answers do not always come in the same order that the paragraphs are in.
4. Study the diagram and try to understand generally what is happening. Donâ€™t spend too much time doing this.
5. Highlight keywords or labels.
6. Scan the text and identify where the information is located.
7. Do the easiest questions first. You are more likely to get these correct. If you cannot find the answer to a difficult question, move on and come back later.
8. Try to predict the answer before you read the text.
