### *Techinques*

Use these 7 steps as a guide when doing ***True / False / Not Given*** or Yes / No / Not Given questions.

1. **The questions follow the order of the text** so you know that the answer to number two will be after number one and before number three.* 

2. ***Don’t read all of the statements first.*** Read statement 1, find it in the text and write your answer. Then read statement two.

3. Read the statement carefully and paraphrase it to make sure you fully understand what it means and then **look for something with the same meaning**.

4. Scan the text to find where the answer is using key words from the question but **don’t just look for keywords, use synonyms and paraphrases**.

5. When you find where the answer is, **read the text carefully to identify** if you think it is True, False or Not Given.

6. **Look out for controlling words** such as “only”, “all’, “never” etc. If the statement in the question says 'some' and the statement in the text says 'all', then it is False. 

7. If you can’t find a statement or the opposite of the statement, then it is probably Not Given. **Don’t waste time looking for something that is not there**.
